# gpt on your data ingestion

Part of [gpt-rag](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag)

## Pre-reqs

- VS Code with Azure Function App Extension
- [AZ CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- Python 3.10
- Contributor role in the *Function App*, *Storage Account* and *Search Service*.

## Deploy (quickstart)

**1) Deploy function to Azure** 

In VSCode with [Azure Function App Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) go to the *Azure* Window, reveal your Function App (Data Ingestion Function) in the resource explorer, right-click it then select *Deploy*.

**2) Azure Cognitive Search Setup**

After you have completed the deployment of the function, wait about 7 Minutes so the Function App can generate the function and its keys.

Then run the setup operation in terminal to create the elements in Cognitive Search executing the following commands:

```
az login
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py -s SUBSCRIPTION_ID -r RESOURCE_GROUP -f FUNCTION_APP_NAME
```
OBS: replace SUBSCRIPTION_ID, RESOURCE_GROUP and FUNCTION_APP_NAME by the names applicable to your deployment.

If Function app is taking too long to generate the function and its keys, you could do another deployment of the function (step 1) and then try the commands above again.

**3) Add source documents to object storage** 

Upload your documents to the *documents* folder in the storage account which name starts with *strag*.
